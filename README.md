## How It Works

1. We create a public repository named `tinymind-blog` in your GitHub account.
2. When you write anything on our webpage, it automatically commits to your `yourname/tinymind-blog` repo.
3. This ensures a seamless way to create content and maintain data persistence.

## Data Privacy & Permissions

Your data remains secure:

- Stored directly in your GitHub repository
- Only write access to public repositories
- Full control via your GitHub account
